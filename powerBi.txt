power bi
business intelligence tool to analyze, transform & visualize the data.
4 components of power bi
-> power Query - analyze, transform & load the data. Also, clean the data for visualization.
-> power pivot - data modeling, create relationship between data
-> power view  - used for charts
-> power bi service - connect users and to share data amongst each other


power bi works

pull data from data sources

 csv
 sql
 excel         --->   power bi desktop(developer tool)   ----> power bi service -> share the reports to all users.
 outlook               cleans data and create reports           
 pdf

To stay updated with powerbi version
File -> options & settings -> options -> preview features -> select -> restart app

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
power Bi charts
Column chart
get data -> upload excel file -> load data -> new visual (stacked column graph) -> Build a visual x-axis -> add data (any column of excel) -> y axis -> add data(any column of y axis)
format data(normally at rightmost part) -> format rows colmns, chart colors, title alignment, boldness of values.

Pie chart
Legend shows which distinct color representing different values
top right -> Add or remove elements from chart 
Similarly we can use other charts
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Include/Exclude filters
create column charts with multiple parameter -> select fields with ctrl button -> right click -> include/exclude filter.

Export filtered data 
create any chart like column chart -> right click the required data by selecting using ctrl button -> file -> export
make sure you are allowing users to export data
File -> options & settings -> options -> current file -> report setting -> allows users to export

Map (bubbled map) (imported source data should have geographical data sets like longitude, latitudes)
use map chart -> build a visual  

filled map can also be used.
Format -> map settings -> style -> change theme of map

Create table -> visual charts -> table -> select columns from imported data into newly created table
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Conditional formatting : format -> cell elements
Matrix chart will allow to have unique values of one data in single row, it avoids to repeat the data value in different rows.
Subtotals can also be added in matrix chart -> row subtotals -> per row level
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Increase font size of overall graph: view -> drop down arrow -> customize current theme -> text.
Gauge chart is used when we have targets.
add threshold target value : home -> new measure -> sum(sheet[column]) * somevalue

cards and maps can be used together. if clicked on map, they will show required values in card 
On card fields, we can right click and choose other option like count.
 we can add filter on current as well as on all pages.
---------------------------------------
3rd party charts - need to sign in for these charts with organization id not with gmail, ymail ids.
more visual -> from app source -> find 3rd party charts name
Animated bar chart,
 drill down donut chart,
 drill down column charts,
 word cloud,
 sankey (provide 1-many relationship)
 infographic (allows user defined icons instead of simple rectangle as in column chart)
 play axis (music player) used generally with other graphs like pie chart
 scroller(similar to news template showing news in channels)
 sunburst(multi donut chart)
 histogram,
-------------------------------------------
Insert any image in power bi : Insert -> insert image
Insert any text in power bi : Insert -> insert text
Insert any shape in power bi : Insert -> insert shape
Insert any button in power bi : Insert -> insert button 
(we can also add action to button like button navigation: select image ->format image -> action -> web url/page navigation)
(we can also add action to button like page naigation: select image ->format image -> action -> page navigation)
(we can also add action to button like button navigation)
use ctrl_click to execute action on power bi
---------------------------------------------
action Bookmark
select graph which should be hidden/shown -> view -> selection -> hide graph
View -> bookmark -> rename  it as hidden
create another bookmark -> grapha visible option should also be selected.
drill through can b added through button action
--------------------------------------------
Create report containing different charts -> home -> publish -> corporate sign in -> myworkspace or link shown of power bi service
export : go to power bi service -> signin -> file -> export 
we can also publish to web but only with paid version
comments acn also be shared
subscribe to report and send daily/weekly mails to requested users.
----------------------------------------------
Dashboards can be creaed on power bi service
my workspace -> dahsboard -> + create 
we can add related graphs here from reports
Limitation: Dashboards jump to main reports and not interactive, reports are interactive.
Solution: we should pin entire report to dashboards.
-----------------------------------------------
Datasets are also added in workspace while uploading to power bi
myworkspace -> datasets -> install gateway (act as interface between datasets and local machine data)
install gateway -> dataset -> setting -> data source credentials -> privacy none
we can also schedule refresh of data at particular time
myworkspace -> datasets -> schedule refresh
--------------------------------------------------
power query editor
Note: transform and add column are same, it's just that transform will add into same column but add column will execute queries in new column
We can add new source -> home -> new source -> browse file

From power bi desktop we can directly goto query editor by home -> transform -> transform data

merge
get data -> transform data -> select columns in sequence using ctrl -> transform -> merge columns -> after merging got to home -> apply & save

split and trim
get data  -> get merged excel data -> transform data -> select columns in sequence using ctrl -> transform -> split columns -> after splitting got to home -> apply & save

uppercase/lowercase
get data  -> get uncleaned data from excel -> transform data -> select columns in sequence using ctrl -> transform -> format -> capitalize columns (makes it in 1st letter capital and rest small)-> after that go to home -> apply & save
similarly, we can add suffix/prefix.

extract first n characters in new column
get data  -> get uncleaned data from excel -> transform -> select columns in sequence using ctrl -> add column/transform -> extract -> first n characters or last n characters -> -> after that go to home -> apply & save

Mr@nitin&jadon -> data is uncleaned -> delimmiter can be used
get data -> get uncleaned data from excel -> transform -> select columns in sequence using ctrl -> add column/transform -> extract -> text after delimiter/text before delimiter/ text between delimiter -> after that go to home -> apply & save
----------------------------------------------
date power query

get date data -> transform -> select columns in sequence using ctrl -> add column/transform -> date -> apply and save

We can also subtract 2 date columns/earliest date/ later date from date section

Date -> day -> name of the day
Date -> month -> name of month
similarly, we can get day of week/month/year, week of month/year
From time, we can get time separately

we can get age from add column/extract -> duration -> age
--------------------------------------------------
arithmetic operations in power query
get data -> select columns -> transform/add column -> standard -> select multiply
we can change the applied formula from "applied steps" if multiplication with some specific values should be done.

rounding off number
select column -> transform/add column -> rounding -> round up/down

check if even/odd/sign of number
select column -> transform/add column -> information -> even/odd/sign
-----------------------------------------------
Column position does not matter names matter

Multiple csv from folder
make sure folder has only csv files -> copy path
get data -> folder -> path -> transform -> and perform required operations

For excel with multiple sheets
get data -> folder -> path -> transform -> home -> append queries select all sheets
similary, we can append queries from different data sources like from csv and excel by using above step.
Now, we need to load only appended data into power bi desktop -> right click unwanted file -> 

Multiple excel files from folder
make sure folder has only excel files -> copy path
get data -> folder -> path -> transform
Note: Content and name columns are important
custom column -> use command Excel.workbook(Content)
expand new column with table only -> expand data of tables from small cursor at heading.

Merge tables with same id (same process tables in separate files and same files)
get data -> documents with 2 table ->transform ->home -> merge queries -> select 2 tables and slect common relation of id -> apply	

merge columns of 2 tables -> home -> merge queries

create new column with pattern similar to selected column
new Column with values similar to first column can be done by home -> column from examples

If new column to be created with If else of some column value like if we have profit 200-300 = average profit, if we have profit >400 = max profit
then add column -> conditional column

if some values are not present in column then, transform -> fill -> fill down

Group by can also be used for grouping with same column name
transform -> group by

remove rows : home -> remove rows/remove blank rows
to have one single column instead of many: right click -> unpivot columns

errors
remove rows : home -> remove row -> remove errors/remove blank rows
replace errors: transform -> replace errors

home -> keep rows : keep selected rows only
------------------------------------------------------------
Copy and send query to another person

view -> advanced editor -> copy query

In avdanced editor we can write custom m language program like
let
  a =10,
  b = 20,
  c = a+b
in
  c

Custom queries can be provided in (add column -> custom column)
like  Date.IsInCurrentMonth([City])
To get list of all m language functions
home -> new source -> blank query -> =#shared
We can search in column filter of shown functions Like "Date", "Text", "Number"
